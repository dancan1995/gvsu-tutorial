                <h3>Variable Interpretations</h3>
                <p><strong>Age:</strong> The sample's age distribution has a mean of 48 years and a standard deviation of 7.97 years, indicating moderate spread. Most individuals fall between 35 (minimum) and 63 (maximum), with the most frequent age being 35.</p>
                <p><strong>BMI:</strong> The average BMI is 29.07, indicating participants are mostly in the overweight range. The values vary narrowly, with a standard deviation of 2.38, spanning from 24.3 to 33.0. The most frequent BMI is 28.5.</p>
                <p><strong>SBP_Pre:</strong> The mean SBP before intervention is 144.3 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 8.07 mmHg. Values range from 130 to 155 mmHg, indicating a hypertensive group requiring intervention. The most common SBP is 145 mmHg.</p>
                <p><strong>DBP_Pre:</strong> The mean DBP is 93 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 7.23 mmHg. Values range from 80 to 105 mmHg, with 95 mmHg being the most frequent value, indicating high diastolic pressure.</p>
                <p><strong>SBP_Post:</strong> The mean SBP decreased to 135.2 mmHg, with a narrower standard deviation of 6.21 mmHg. Values now range from 125 to 145 mmHg, with 135 mmHg as the most frequent value, reflecting improved control post-intervention.</p>
                <p><strong>DBP_Post:</strong> The mean DBP decreased to 87.3 mmHg, with a standard deviation of 4.74 mmHg. Values range from 78 to 95 mmHg, with the most frequent value being 85 mmHg, indicating tighter control of diastolic pressure.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The analysis of the sample's health metrics reveals several critical insights regarding the participants' demographics and health status. The age distribution indicates a mature population, predominantly in the overweight category, as reflected by the average BMI. The elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings prior to intervention suggest a significant prevalence of hypertension among participants, highlighting a need for medical intervention.</p>
                <p>Post-intervention results demonstrate a marked improvement in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, indicating that the intervention was effective in managing hypertension. This positive change suggests that the strategies employed during the intervention were successful in promoting better cardiovascular health among participants.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the data underscores the importance of targeted health interventions for managing weight and blood pressure, particularly in populations at risk due to age and existing health conditions. Continued monitoring and further studies may be beneficial to assess long-term outcomes and refine intervention strategies.</p>

                <h3>Independent Samples Test Interpretation</h3>
                <h3>Analysis of SBP_Pre</h3>
                <p>The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) for males was 147.00 mmHg (SD = 6.851), while for females, it was 141.60 mmHg (SD = 8.345). Levene's test for equality of variances yielded an F-value of 1.629 (p = 0.205), indicating equal variances can be assumed. The independent samples t-test revealed a statistically significant difference in SBP between genders, with t(98) = 3.537, p = 0.001. The mean difference of 5.400 mmHg (SE = 1.527) indicates that males had a higher SBP than females. The 95% confidence interval for this difference ranged from 2.370 to 8.430 mmHg.</p>
                <h3>Analysis of DBP_Pre</h3>
                <p>The mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for males was 94.00 mmHg (SD = 5.890), while for females, it was 92.00 mmHg (SD = 8.305). Levene's test for equality of variances yielded an F-value of 2.100 (p = 0.150), supporting the assumption of equal variances. The independent samples t-test showed no statistically significant difference in DBP between genders, with t(98) = 1.389, p = 0.168. The mean difference was 2.000 mmHg (SE = 1.440), with a 95% confidence interval of -0.858 to 4.858 mmHg.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The results indicate a significant difference in SBP between males and females, with males having higher SBP. However, no significant difference was observed in DBP between genders. Further investigation is warranted to understand the factors contributing to these differences.</p>

            <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The paired samples statistics compare diastolic blood pressure (DBP) before (Pre) and after (Post) intervention in 100 participants. The mean DBP decreased significantly from 93.00 to 87.30, with a high correlation (r = .890, p < .001), indicating consistency in the paired measurements. The paired samples t-test reveals a mean difference of 5.70 (95% CI: 4.96 to 6.44), showing a statistically significant reduction in DBP (t = 15.373, df = 99, p < .001). This suggests the intervention effectively reduced DBP. The small standard error (.371) and significant results highlight the reliability and importance of this finding.</p>

    <img src="https://imgur.com/XEu05ho.png" alt="One-Way ANOVA Output" width="600" height="200">
        <h3>Hypotheses</h3>
        <p><strong>Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>):</strong> There is no significant difference in the pre-intervention systolic blood pressure (SBP_Pre) between groups defined by compliance levels.</p>
        <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>):</strong> There is a significant difference in the pre-intervention systolic blood pressure (SBP_Pre) between groups defined by compliance levels.</p>

        <h3>Interpretation</h3>
        <p>The one-way ANOVA test evaluates SBP_Pre differences across 8 compliance groups. The results indicate a statistically significant difference in SBP_Pre among the groups (<strong>F</strong> = 325.470, <strong>p</strong> &lt; .001). The between-groups variability (Sum of Squares = 6191.000) is much larger than the within-groups variability (Sum of Squares = 250.000), suggesting that compliance groups account for substantial variance in SBP_Pre. The mean square for between groups (884.429) far exceeds that within groups (2.717), reflecting strong group effects.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Since the p-value is less than .05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that compliance levels significantly influence pre-intervention systolic blood pressure. Further post hoc tests are recommended to identify specific group differences.</p>

    <img src="https://imgur.com/bfga5lA.png" alt="Chi-Square Test Output" width="500" height="400">
    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The crosstabulation results highlight significant differences in outcomes between genders. Among females, 80% (40 out of 50) showed improvement, while 20% (10 out of 50) showed partial improvement. In contrast, all males (100%) demonstrated improvement, with no instances of partial improvement. Females accounted for 44.4% of the "Improved" group and 100% of the "Partially Improved" group, whereas males contributed 55.6% to the "Improved" group and 0% to the "Partially Improved" group. Overall, 90% of participants improved, and 10% had partial improvement.</p>
    <p>The Chi-Square test further confirms a significant association between gender and outcomes. The Pearson Chi-Square statistic (11.111, p = .001) and other tests, including the Fisher’s Exact Test (p = .001), indicate strong evidence of gender differences in outcomes. Notably, all expected cell counts exceed 5, ensuring the test's validity. These findings suggest gender-specific patterns, with males showing consistently better outcomes and females exhibiting variability, warranting further investigation into underlying factors.</p>

    <h3>Correlation Matrix</h3>
    <img src="https://imgur.com/ecbJSvZ.png" alt="Correlation Matrix" width="600" height="400">
    <h3>Correlation Matrix Interpretation</h3>

    <h4>1. Age and BMI</h4>
    <p>There is a <strong>strong positive correlation</strong> between Age and BMI (<strong>0.881</strong>, p < 0.01), meaning that older individuals tend to have higher BMI values.</p>

    <h4>2. Age and Blood Pressure (SBP_Pre, DBP_Pre, SBP_Post, DBP_Post)</h4>
    <p>Age is positively correlated with all blood pressure variables, with the correlations ranging from <strong>0.592</strong> (SBP_Pre) to <strong>0.626</strong> (SBP_Post). All these correlations are statistically significant (p < 0.01), suggesting that older individuals tend to have higher blood pressure values before and after measurement.</p>

    <h4>3. BMI and Blood Pressure (SBP_Pre, DBP_Pre, SBP_Post, DBP_Post)</h4>
    <p>BMI also shows positive correlations with all blood pressure variables, ranging from <strong>0.505</strong> (DBP_Post) to <strong>0.554</strong> (SBP_Post), all statistically significant (p < 0.01). This implies that higher BMI values are associated with higher blood pressure values.</p>

    <h4>4. SBP_Pre and DBP_Pre</h4>
    <p>These two pre-measurements of blood pressure have a <strong>very strong positive correlation</strong> (<strong>0.952</strong>, p < 0.01), indicating that people with higher systolic blood pressure before measurement tend to have higher diastolic blood pressure prior to measurement as well.</p>

    <h4>5. SBP_Post and DBP_Post</h4>
    <p>Similarly, there is a <strong>very strong positive correlation</strong> (<strong>0.980</strong>, p < 0.01) between the post-measurement systolic and diastolic blood pressures, meaning that higher systolic blood pressure after measurement correlates highly with higher diastolic blood pressure after measurement.</p>

    <h4>6. Pre and Post Blood Pressure Measures</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>SBP_Pre and SBP_Post have a <strong>very strong positive correlation</strong> (<strong>0.933</strong>, p < 0.01), meaning that higher systolic blood pressure before measurement is associated with higher systolic blood pressure after measurement.</li>
        <li>DBP_Pre and DBP_Post also show a <strong>very strong positive correlation</strong> (<strong>0.890</strong>, p < 0.01), meaning that higher diastolic blood pressure before measurement is associated with higher diastolic blood pressure after measurement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7. Compliance</h4>
    <p>Compliance has weak and non-significant correlations with the other variables:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Compliance and Age:</strong> A <strong>very weak positive correlation</strong> of <strong>0.054</strong> (p = 0.596), not statistically significant.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance and BMI:</strong> A <strong>weak positive correlation</strong> of <strong>0.133</strong> (p = 0.188), not statistically significant.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance and Blood Pressure (Pre and Post):</strong> All correlations with blood pressure values (both pre and post) are weak and non-significant, ranging from <strong>0.064</strong> (SBP_Pre) to <strong>-0.123</strong> (DBP_Post). This suggests that compliance with the intervention is not strongly associated with age, BMI, or blood pressure levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p><strong>Age</strong> and <strong>BMI</strong> show strong correlations with each other and with blood pressure measures, both pre and post.</p>
    <p><strong>Blood pressure measures (SBP and DBP)</strong> are highly correlated with each other across pre- and post-measurements.</p>
    <p><strong>Compliance</strong> does not show significant relationships with age, BMI, or blood pressure levels, indicating that it may not be influenced by these variables in this dataset.</p>

    <h2>1. Variables Entered/Removed</h2>
    <p>The regression analysis includes <strong>Age</strong> as the independent variable, with <strong>Compliance</strong> as the dependent variable. No variables were removed, and the method used is "Enter," meaning all entered variables are included in the model.</p>

    <h2>2. Model Summary</h2>
    <p>The model summary presents the following key statistics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>R</strong>: <strong>0.054</strong> — This indicates a very weak linear relationship between Age and Compliance.</li>
        <li><strong>R Square</strong>: <strong>0.003</strong> — Only 0.3% of the variance in Compliance is explained by Age, which suggests a very weak explanatory power.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjusted R Square</strong>: <strong>-0.007</strong> — The negative value indicates that Age is not a good predictor of Compliance, and the model does not improve when adjusting for the number of predictors.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Error of the Estimate</strong>: <strong>7.467</strong> — This is the standard deviation of the residuals, indicating how much the observed values of Compliance deviate from the predicted values. A higher value suggests a larger spread of data points around the regression line.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>F-value</strong>: <strong>0.283</strong> — This is the ratio of the variance explained by the model to the variance unexplained. A small F-value indicates that the model does not explain much variance in the dependent variable.</li>
        <li><strong>Significance (Sig.)</strong>: <strong>0.596</strong> — Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we conclude that the model is not statistically significant. Age does not significantly predict Compliance in this model.</li>
        <li><strong>Sum of Squares (Regression)</strong>: <strong>15.775</strong> — This is the explained variance by the regression model.</li>
        <li><strong>Sum of Squares (Residual)</strong>: <strong>5464.225</strong> — This represents the unexplained variance, which is much larger than the explained variance, suggesting that the model does not fit the data well.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Coefficients</h2>
    <p>The coefficients table presents the unstandardized and standardized coefficients for the predictor variable (Age):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Intercept (Constant)</strong>: <strong>81.596</strong> — This is the predicted value of Compliance when Age is zero.</li>
        <li><strong>Age (Unstandardized Coefficient)</strong>: <strong>0.050</strong> — This indicates that for each one-unit increase in Age, Compliance is expected to increase by 0.050 units. However, this effect is very small.</li>
        <li><strong>Age (Standardized Coefficient)</strong>: <strong>0.054</strong> — This shows the effect size of Age on Compliance in standardized units. A very small value suggests a weak effect.</li>
        <li><strong>t-value</strong>: <strong>0.532</strong> — The t-value tests the hypothesis that the coefficient is significantly different from zero. A low t-value indicates that the relationship between Age and Compliance is not statistically significant.</li>
        <li><strong>Significance (Sig.)</strong>: <strong>0.596</strong> — The p-value is much greater than 0.05, indicating that Age is not a statistically significant predictor of Compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the regression analysis shows that Age does not significantly predict Compliance in this model. The very small R-square value (0.003) and the p-value (0.596) indicate that Age has little to no explanatory power in predicting Compliance. The model does not fit the data well, and Age is not a statistically significant predictor of Compliance.</p>

    <h1>Regression Analysis Interpretation</h1>

    <h2>1. Model Summary</h2>
    <p>The model summary for the regression analysis with the predictors <strong>DBP_Post</strong>, <strong>FollowUpWeeks</strong>, <strong>BMI</strong>, <strong>DBP_Pre</strong>, <strong>Age</strong>, <strong>SBP_Pre</strong>, and <strong>SBP_Post</strong> shows the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>R</strong>: <strong>0.950</strong> — This indicates a very strong linear relationship between the predictors and the dependent variable (Compliance).</li>
        <li><strong>R Square</strong>: <strong>0.902</strong> — This means that 90.2% of the variance in Compliance is explained by the model, which is a very good fit.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjusted R Square</strong>: <strong>0.895</strong> — The adjusted R-square value accounts for the number of predictors and suggests that the model fits the data well, even with the number of predictors.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Error of the Estimate</strong>: <strong>2.411</strong> — This is the standard deviation of the residuals, indicating that the observed values of Compliance deviate from the predicted values by an average of 2.411 units.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)</h2>
    <p>The ANOVA table tests the overall significance of the regression model:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>F-value</strong>: <strong>121.554</strong> — The large F-value indicates that the model explains a substantial amount of the variance in Compliance.</li>
        <li><strong>Significance (Sig.)</strong>: <strong>0.000</strong> — Since the p-value is less than 0.05, the model is statistically significant, and we reject the null hypothesis that the model has no explanatory power.</li>
        <li><strong>Sum of Squares (Regression)</strong>: <strong>4945.297</strong> — This represents the variance explained by the regression model.</li>
        <li><strong>Sum of Squares (Residual)</strong>: <strong>534.703</strong> — This is the unexplained variance, which is much smaller than the explained variance, suggesting that the model fits the data well.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Coefficients</h2>
    <p>The coefficients table presents the unstandardized and standardized coefficients for the predictors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Intercept (Constant)</strong>: <strong>130.703</strong> — This is the predicted value of Compliance when all predictor variables are zero.</li>
        <li><strong>Age (Unstandardized Coefficient)</strong>: <strong>0.275</strong> — For each one-unit increase in Age, Compliance is expected to increase by 0.275 units, with a statistically significant p-value (0.000).</li>
        <li><strong>BMI (Unstandardized Coefficient)</strong>: <strong>-0.144</strong> — For each one-unit increase in BMI, Compliance is expected to decrease by 0.144 units. However, the p-value (0.531) indicates that this effect is not statistically significant.</li>
        <li><strong>FollowUpWeeks (Unstandardized Coefficient)</strong>: <strong>2.458</strong> — For each additional week of follow-up, Compliance is expected to increase by 2.458 units, and this effect is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.000.</li>
        <li><strong>SBP_Pre (Unstandardized Coefficient)</strong>: <strong>0.733</strong> — For each one-unit increase in SBP_Pre, Compliance is expected to increase by 0.733 units, with a statistically significant p-value of 0.000.</li>
        <li><strong>DBP_Pre (Unstandardized Coefficient)</strong>: <strong>-0.078</strong> — For each one-unit increase in DBP_Pre, Compliance is expected to decrease by 0.078 units. The p-value (0.551) shows that this effect is not statistically significant.</li>
        <li><strong>SBP_Post (Unstandardized Coefficient)</strong>: <strong>-0.233</strong> — For each one-unit increase in SBP_Post, Compliance is expected to decrease by 0.233 units, but the effect is not statistically significant with a p-value of 0.278.</li>
        <li><strong>DBP_Post (Unstandardized Coefficient)</strong>: <strong>-1.637</strong> — For each one-unit increase in DBP_Post, Compliance is expected to decrease by 1.637 units, and this effect is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.000.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the regression analysis shows that several predictors have a statistically significant effect on Compliance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Age</strong> (p = 0.000), <strong>FollowUpWeeks</strong> (p = 0.000), <strong>SBP_Pre</strong> (p = 0.000), and <strong>DBP_Post</strong> (p = 0.000) are all significant predictors of Compliance.</li>
        <li><strong>BMI</strong> (p = 0.531), <strong>DBP_Pre</strong> (p = 0.551), and <strong>SBP_Post</strong> (p = 0.278) are not significant predictors of Compliance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The model explains a large proportion of the variance in Compliance (90.2%), making it a good fit for the data. However, not all predictors are significant, suggesting that further refinement of the model might be needed to improve its explanatory power.</p>

    <p>In general, the regression model explains a substantial portion of the variance in Compliance (R² = 0.902), with significant predictors such as Age, FollowUpWeeks, SBP_Pre, and DBP_Post. However, the logistic regression model did not show significant effects for Age, Gender, BMI, or Compliance, suggesting the need for further model refinement.</p>

    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that the survival probability decreases over time. After 12 months, the estimated survival probability is 55%, meaning 55% of the subjects are expected to survive past 12 months. The number of events (deaths or other endpoints) increases as time progresses, leading to a decline in survival probability.</p>
    
    <p>Based on the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, the survival rate drops sharply between 6 and 12 months, indicating that this period might be critical in the study population. Further analysis, such as the log-rank test, can be conducted to compare survival curves across different groups (e.g., treatment vs. control).</p>
